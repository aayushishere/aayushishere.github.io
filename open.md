# About Me

**Hi, I am Aayush,**
{:.lead}

I am a pre-final year student at ABV-IIITM Gwalior pursuing an Integrated Btech + MBA degree in Information Technology. My academic course is a bit unique, its a perfect blend of **Technology** and **Business** which enables me to combine both disiplines and have a better perspective of the current market space where technology is on the rise and businesses need to keep up with the latest trends to beat their competition. I like working on creative projects and building innovative solutions for problems *(check out the portfolio section for some of my projects)*. Currently I am starting my MBA and exploring and learning about different business concepts and working on building my skills.

## This Website's Purpose

I am creating this website with two goals in mind -
{:.lead}

- This website will be a showcase of all the projects I have worked on. So, basically my portfolio.

- I believe that life is about learning something new everyday. This website will be a means for me to share all the things I have learned or will be learning in future.
